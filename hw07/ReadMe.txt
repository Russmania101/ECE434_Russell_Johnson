Blynk
    - Blynk has been installed on my BeagleBone and on my iPhone
    - Sample program runs great
    - Created a button widget to control the USR3 LED, and it works great
    - I also hooked up a button to p9_25 in order to control a virutal LED on my phone - works great

A Slider
    - I added a slider to Blynk and used it to control an LED on P9_14 - works great
        - look in leds.js
